## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities privately. Do not open a public issue.

Preferred channel:

- GitHub Security Advisories: https://github.com/hugo-lorenzo-mato/quorum-ai/security/advisories/new

If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, open a standard issue and clearly
mark it as a security report. The maintainers will move the discussion to a
private channel as soon as possible.

When reporting, please include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment
- Any available proof of concept or exploit details
- A suggested fix or mitigation if you have one

## Response Timeline

We aim to:

- Acknowledge receipt within 3 business days
- Provide an initial triage response within 7 business days
- Provide a remediation plan or status update within 30 days

Timelines may vary depending on severity and scope, but we will keep you
informed.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure:

- We will work with you to validate the issue and identify a fix
- We will provide a public disclosure after a fix is available
- We will credit reporters who want attribution
