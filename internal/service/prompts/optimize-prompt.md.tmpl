# Prompt Optimization Request

## Original User Prompt
{{.OriginalPrompt}}

## Instructions
Your task is to optimize the above prompt for better clarity and effectiveness when used with AI coding assistants. The optimization should:

1. **Preserve Intent**: Maintain the original meaning and goals exactly
2. **Add Clarity**: Remove ambiguity, add specificity where helpful
3. **Structure**: Organize into clear sections if the prompt is complex
4. **Context**: Ensure sufficient context is provided for the task
5. **Actionable**: Make the request actionable and measurable

## Constraints
- Do NOT change the fundamental request or add new requirements
- Do NOT remove any requirements from the original prompt
- Keep the optimized prompt concise but complete
- Preserve the user's preferred language (respond in the same language as the input)
- If the prompt is already clear and well-structured, minimal changes are acceptable

## Response Format
Provide your response in the following JSON structure:
```json
{
  "optimized_prompt": "The improved version of the user's prompt",
  "changes_made": ["List of specific changes made to improve the prompt"],
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why these changes improve the prompt"
}
```
