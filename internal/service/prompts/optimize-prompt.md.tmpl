4. **Context**: Ensure sufficient context is provided for the task
5. **Actionable**: Make the request actionable and measurable

## Constraints

- Do NOT remove any requirements from the original prompt
- Keep the optimized prompt concise but complete
- Preserve the user's preferred language (respond in the same language as the input)
