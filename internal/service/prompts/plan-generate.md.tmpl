## Instructions
Based on the analysis above, generate an execution plan with discrete tasks.

Requirements:
- Maximum {{.MaxTasks}} tasks
- Each task should be independently executable
- Tasks should have clear dependencies
- Estimate complexity (low/medium/high)
- Return at least one task
- If you set agent/cli, it must be a configured agent name (leave empty to use the default)
- Return only JSON. Do not include markdown or extra text.

## Response Format
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "task-1",
      "name": "Task name",
      "description": "What this task accomplishes",
      "dependencies": [],
      "complexity": "low|medium|high",
      "agent": "preferred agent name"
    }
  ],
  "execution_order": ["task-1", "task-2"]
