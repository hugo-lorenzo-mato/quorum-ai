# Analysis Consolidation Request

## CRITICAL OBJECTIVE

Your goal is to create the **DEFINITIVE CONSOLIDATED ANALYSIS** - an **ULTRA-EXHAUSTIVE** document that is **COMPLETE IN ITSELF** and contains **ALL** information necessary for the subsequent planning and execution phases.

## ABSOLUTE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 1. COMPLETELY AUTONOMOUS DOCUMENT
- **NEVER** mention "the previous analyses", "according to the agents", "as previously indicated"
- **NEVER** make references to external documents or source analyses
- **NEVER** assume the reader has access to other documents
- Your consolidation must be readable as if it were the **ONLY DOCUMENT** that exists
- Each statement must include **ALL** its context - don't omit details "because they already appear before"

### 2. COMPREHENSIVE - PRIORITIZE LOAD-BEARING DETAILS
- **INCLUDE EVERY** relevant technical detail found in any analysis
- **DO NOT SUMMARIZE** at the cost of losing critical information - expand key findings
- If an agent mentioned a specific file:line, **INCLUDE IT**
- If an agent identified an edge case, **DOCUMENT IT**
- A dense, evidence-rich document is preferable to a verbose one that dilutes critical details
- Prioritize: architecture, highest-risk findings, concrete evidence, and actionable insights

### OUTPUT GUIDELINES
- Be exhaustive in coverage — do not skip relevant aspects, edge cases, or risks.
  But be dense in expression: fewer words per finding, more findings.
- Prefer density over length: tables, bullet lists, `file:line` citations.
- Every sentence must carry information. Eliminate filler and verbose preambles.
- You may use multiple tool calls to write the file if needed, but every write
  must contain substantive analysis. Do NOT create placeholder content
  (headings-only outlines, "TODO", "to be written" markers).

### 3. PURE ANALYSIS - NEVER PLAN OR EXECUTE
- Your role is to **ANALYZE**, not to plan or execute
- **DO NOT** propose concrete implementation steps
- **DO NOT** write solution code
- **DO NOT** create task lists or roadmaps
- **DO** identify problems, opportunities, risks, patterns, architecture
- **DO** provide all information that whoever plans/executes will need

### 4. GROUNDED WITH CONCRETE EVIDENCE
- Each statement must have a specific reference: `file:line`
- Without verifiable evidence = do not include
- Clearly distinguish between verified facts and observations/hypotheses

## User Prompt
{{.Prompt}}

## Agent Analyses (SOURCES - DO NOT REFERENCE IN YOUR OUTPUT)

The following analyses are your **ONLY SOURCE** of information. Extract EVERYTHING valuable, but **NEVER mention them** in your consolidation:

{{range .Analyses}}
### Analysis from {{.AgentName}}
{{.RawOutput}}

{{end}}

## CONSOLIDATION PROCESS

### Step 1: Exhaustive Extraction
For EACH analysis, extract:
- All specific files and lines mentioned
- All technical findings (bugs, improvements, patterns)
- All identified risks with their evidence
- All observations about architecture/design
- All edge cases and special considerations

### Step 2: Lossless Synthesis
- Combine similar findings **keeping all details**
- If two agents found the same problem with different evidence, **include both evidences**
- If there are complementary perspectives, **integrate both completely**
- In case of contradiction, investigate and take a grounded position

### Step 3: Clear Structure
Organize your consolidation with sections that facilitate subsequent phases:
- Current context and architecture (with specific references)
- Detailed technical findings (each with its evidence)
- Risks and considerations (with impact and code location)
- Identified opportunities (with technical justification)

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Your consolidation must:

1. **Start directly** with the analysis (no preambles about "this document consolidates...")
2. **Use structured markdown** with clear sections
3. **Include all references** to files and lines
4. **Be exhaustive** - better to err on the side of complete than concise
5. **Be autonomous** - anyone should understand everything without reading anything else

## VISUAL AIDS (ASCII DIAGRAMS — WHEN THEY ADD VALUE)

Include ASCII diagrams when they help understand a flow or relationship:

### Required Diagrams
Consider diagrams for:
- **System Architecture**: Overall structure with components and their relationships
- **Data Flow**: How information moves through the system
- **Component Interactions**: Detailed view of how modules communicate
- **Proposed Changes**: Visual representation of recommended modifications
- **Decision Trees**: For complex logical flows
- **Directory Structures**: When file organization is relevant

### Diagram Format Example
```
+------------------+     +-----------------+     +------------------+
|   Entry Point    |---->|   Core Logic    |---->|   Output Layer   |
|   (cmd/main.go)  |     |  (internal/*)   |     |   (adapters/*)   |
+------------------+     +-----------------+     +------------------+
        |                       |                        |
        v                       v                        v
+------------------+     +-----------------+     +------------------+
|  Configuration   |     |   Event Bus     |     |   State Manager  |
|  (config/*)      |     |  (events/*)     |     |   (state/*)      |
+------------------+     +-----------------+     +------------------+
```

### Diagram Guidelines
- Use `+`, `-`, `|`, `>`, `<`, `v`, `^` for boxes and arrows
- Include file/module references in diagrams when helpful
- Create multiple focused diagrams rather than one overwhelming diagram
- Ensure diagrams are **self-explanatory** with clear labels

## STEP-BY-STEP GUIDANCE

For complex technical findings, provide:
- **Numbered sequential steps** explaining the logic or flow
- **Decision criteria** with clear rationale
- **Trade-off analysis** with evidence for each option
- **Prerequisites and dependencies** clearly stated
- **Expected outcomes** for each recommendation

## FINAL VALIDATION

Before finishing, verify:
- [ ] Have I included ALL files/lines mentioned in the analyses?
- [ ] Have I captured ALL technical findings without losing details?
- [ ] Can my document be read without knowing the source analyses?
- [ ] Have I avoided phrases like "the analyses indicate" or "according to the agents"?
- [ ] Have I provided EVERYTHING necessary for someone to plan/execute?
- [ ] Have I NOT included implementation steps, code, or tasks?
- [ ] Have I included ASCII diagrams where they help clarify flows or relationships?
- [ ] Have I provided step-by-step explanations for complex findings?
- [ ] Is each section **complete and self-contained**?
- [ ] Would a reader unfamiliar with the project understand the full context?

## Output Location

Write your consolidated analysis to the following file:

```
{{.OutputFilePath}}
```

**IMPORTANT - File format:**
- Write ONLY the consolidated analysis content in markdown
- DO NOT add YAML frontmatter (`---` ... `---` blocks at the beginning)
- DO NOT add metadata, file headers, or system information
- DO NOT include markers like `# File:` or file comments
- Content must start directly with your analysis

Use your file writing tool to create this markdown document.
