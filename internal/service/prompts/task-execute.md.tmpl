## CRITICAL: Scope Adherence

**IMPORTANT**: The task description above contains **ALL** the information and context you need to complete this task.

- **DO NOT** make changes outside the scope defined in the task description
- **DO NOT** add features or improvements not explicitly requested
- **DO NOT** assume or invent requirements not mentioned
- **DO** follow the task description exactly as written
- **DO** implement only what is explicitly requested
- **DO** ask for clarification if the task description is ambiguous (report as blocker)

The task description was carefully crafted to be self-contained. Trust it as your single source of truth.

## Context Management

Optimize the use of your context:

- **Locate first**: Use grep to find the exact lines before reading complete files
- **Scoped reads**: If you need a large file, read only the relevant line range
- **One change at a time**: Complete and verify each modification before moving to the next
- **Delegate if necessary**: For large refactors, consider splitting into sub-tasks

## Instructions

Execute the task described above. Follow these guidelines:
1. Make minimal, focused changes as specified in the task
2. Ensure code compiles and tests pass
3. Document any significant decisions
4. Report any blockers or issues (especially if task description is unclear)
