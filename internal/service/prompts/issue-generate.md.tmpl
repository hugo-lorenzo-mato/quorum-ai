# GitHub/GitLab Issue Generation

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ CAREFULLY

You are generating GitHub/GitLab issues from workflow artifacts.

**YOU MUST**:
1. **READ** the source files using your Read tool
2. **WRITE** issue markdown files directly to disk using your Write tool
3. Each issue must be clean, actionable, and ready for GitHub/GitLab

**DO NOT include in issues:**
- Model names or versions (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, etc.)
- Agent names or AI references
- Generation timestamps or dates
- Internal IDs, workflow IDs, or task IDs
- Technical metadata about the generation process
- YAML frontmatter or metadata blocks from source files
- File paths or directory references
- Debug information or logs
- Any content that reveals this was AI-generated

**Your job is to transform the analysis into clean, professional issues that look like they were written by a human developer.**

## Source Files to Read

You MUST read these files to understand the work:

### Consolidated Analysis
**Path**: `{{.ConsolidatedAnalysisPath}}`

### Task Specification Files
{{range .TaskFiles}}
- `{{.Path}}` ({{.ID}}: {{.Name}})
{{end}}

---

## Output Configuration

### Output Directory
**Issues Directory**: `{{.IssuesDir}}`

### File Naming Convention
**CRITICAL**: You MUST use EXACTLY these filenames. Do not deviate:

{{if .ConsolidatedAnalysisPath}}
- `00-consolidated-analysis.md` - Main issue summarizing the overall analysis
{{end}}
{{range $i, $task := .TaskFiles}}
- `{{printf "%02d" $task.Index}}-{{$task.Slug}}.md` - Issue for {{$task.ID}}
{{end}}

**DO NOT create files with these patterns**:
- ❌ `issue-1-*.md`, `issue-2-*.md` (wrong prefix)
- ❌ `issue-task-1.md`, `issue-task-2.md` (wrong format)
- ❌ `01-task.md` without the slug (incomplete)

**Only use the EXACT filenames listed above.**

---

## Issue Format Requirements

Each issue file MUST have this structure:

```markdown
# [Descriptive Title of the Objective]

## Summary
[Brief description of what this issue addresses]

## Details
[Detailed technical content from the source file]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Specific, verifiable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Specific, verifiable criterion 2]
...

{{if .IncludeTestingSection}}
## Testing Requirements
[How to verify this issue is resolved]
{{end}}
```

### Title Requirements (CRITICAL)

The issue title (the `# ` H1 heading) must be:
- **Descriptive**: Clearly explains the objective or goal of the task
- **Clean**: No numeric prefixes, no internal markers, no slugs
- **Professional**: Written as a human would write it for a real project

**DO NOT use these patterns in titles:**
- ❌ `# 01-implement-auth` (numeric prefix)
- ❌ `# task-001: Implement Auth` (task marker)
- ❌ `# 001-add-pagination` (numeric prefix)
- ❌ `# implement-user-authentication` (slug format with dashes)

**USE descriptive titles like:**
- ✅ `# Implement User Authentication`
- ✅ `# Add Pagination to Product Listing`
- ✅ `# Fix Memory Leak in Cache Service`
- ✅ `# Refactor Database Connection Pool`

**Note**: The filename can have numeric prefixes for ordering (e.g., `01-implement-auth.md`), but the H1 title inside the file must be clean and descriptive.

## YOUR MISSION

1. **READ** the consolidated analysis file (if provided)
2. **READ** each task specification file
3. **WRITE** one issue markdown file for each source file to the issues directory
4. **USE EXACT FILENAMES** specified above - do not create variations
5. Ensure each issue is self-contained and actionable

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Use your Read tool to read the source files
- Use your Write tool to create the issue files
- Do NOT output the content in your response - write it directly to files
- Do NOT create multiple files for the same task
- Follow the exact naming convention specified above

## BEGIN

Read the source files and generate the issue files now. Remember: use the EXACT filenames listed in the File Naming Convention section.
