# Task Manifest Generation

## Original Request
{{.Prompt}}

## Consolidated Analysis
{{.ConsolidatedAnalysis}}

## Instructions

Generate a **lightweight task manifest** with metadata only. The detailed task specifications will be generated separately.

### What to Generate

Create a JSON manifest containing ONLY:
- Task identifiers
- Task names (short, descriptive)
- Dependencies between tasks
- CLI/agent assignment
- Complexity estimation

**DO NOT include task descriptions** - those will be generated separately by CLIs.

### Requirements

- Maximum {{.MaxTasks}} tasks
- Each task should be independently executable
- Tasks should have clear dependencies
- Estimate complexity (low/medium/high)
- Return at least one task
- If you set agent/cli, it must be a configured agent name (leave empty to use the default)
- Return **ONLY** the JSON manifest. No markdown, no explanations.

## Response Format
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "task-1",
      "name": "Short descriptive task name",
      "dependencies": [],
      "complexity": "low|medium|high",
      "cli": "preferred agent name or empty"
    },
    {
      "id": "task-2",
      "name": "Another task name",
      "dependencies": ["task-1"],
      "complexity": "medium",
      "cli": ""
    }
  ]
}
```

**CRITICAL**: Return ONLY the JSON. No markdown code blocks, no explanations, no additional text.
