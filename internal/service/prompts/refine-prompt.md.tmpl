# Prompt Enhancement Request

## Original User Prompt
{{.OriginalPrompt}}

## Instructions

Your task is to ENHANCE and IMPROVE the above prompt to maximize the quality of results when used with AI coding assistants for codebase analysis. The enhancement should:

1. **Expand Context**: Add relevant technical context that would help understand the task better
2. **Clarify Scope**: Define clear boundaries - what should be included/excluded from analysis
3. **Add Specificity**: Include specific technical aspects to consider (architecture, patterns, security, performance, etc.)
4. **Structure for Analysis**: Organize the request into clear sections suitable for multi-agent analysis
5. **Define Success Criteria**: Add measurable outcomes or deliverables expected
6. **Technical Depth**: Add technical considerations the user might not have explicitly mentioned but are relevant

## Critical Attitude Requirements

The enhanced prompt MUST instruct the AI to adopt an **ultra-critical** analytical attitude:

1. **Force Deep Analysis**: Include phrases like:
   - "Analyze in depth"
   - "With maximum thoroughness"
   - "Don't omit any relevant aspect"

2. **Require Evidence**: The prompt should demand:
   - Specific file/line references for claims
   - Concrete code evidence for risks
   - Actionable recommendations with clear steps

3. **Question Assumptions**: Include instructions to:
   - Challenge unfounded assumptions
   - Validate claims against actual code
   - Distinguish facts from speculation

## Enhancement Goals

- **DO** expand the prompt with helpful context and specifications
- **DO** add technical considerations relevant to the task
- **DO** structure complex requests into clear, analyzable components
- **DO** suggest areas of analysis that would be valuable
- **DO** include ultra-critical attitude keywords (exhaustive, grounded, in depth)
- **DO NOT** remove any requirements from the original prompt
- **DO NOT** change the fundamental request or user's intent
- **DO NOT** prioritize brevity over completeness
- Preserve the user's preferred language (respond in the same language as the input)

## CRITICAL: Response Format

Respond with ONLY the enhanced prompt. Do NOT include any headers, explanations, or meta-commentary.
Do NOT write "## Optimized Prompt" or any section headers.
Do NOT explain what changes you made.
Just output the improved prompt directly, nothing else.
