# Analysis Refinement (Round {{.Round}})

## PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

Your goal is to create the **BEST POSSIBLE ANALYSIS** by synthesizing:
- The strengths of all participating models/agents
- The agreement points already established
- Resolution of dissonant points with concrete evidence

## CRITICAL RULES

### 1. COMPLETE and Autonomous Analysis (MANDATORY)

**Your V{{.Round}} must be a COMPLETE and INDEPENDENT analysis.**

- **NEVER** reference previous versions (V1, V2, V3...)
- **NEVER** mention "in the previous analysis", "as stated before", etc.
- **NEVER** write "in addition to the above" or "keeping previous points"
- Your analysis must be readable WITHOUT knowing any previous version
- Each statement must be complete with its context and evidence

### 2. Synthesis of Strengths

**Integrate the best of each perspective without explicitly mentioning them.**

- Gather valuable insights from other models/agents
- Incorporate observations that complement your analysis
- If another agent identified something you didn't see, include it as a natural part of your analysis
- The result must be superior to any individual analysis

### 3. Divergence Resolution

**Progressively reduce points of disagreement.**

- Ground each point with specific code evidence (file:line)
- If there are contradictory positions, investigate the code to determine which is correct
- If you cannot verify something, DO NOT include it
- Eliminate hallucinations and unfounded statements

**FORBIDDEN to write:**
- "As I mentioned in V{{.PreviousRound}}..."
- "In addition to the above..."
- "The arbiter pointed out that..."
- "Other agents indicated..."
- "In the previous round..."

**CORRECT:**
- Write each point as if it were the first time you're presenting it
- Integrate improvements naturally without external references
- Each section must be self-contained and complete

## Analysis V{{.PreviousRound}} to Review

Your analysis from the previous round (use as base, but generate a complete document):
{{.PreviousAnalysis}}

{{if .HasArbiterEvaluation}}
## Arbiter Evaluation

An impartial arbiter evaluated the consensus among all agents. Current score: **{{printf "%.0f" .ConsensusScore}}%** (threshold: {{printf "%.0f" .Threshold}}%)

### Established Agreements (PRESERVE THESE)
The following points have consensus among all agents. You MUST keep them in your refined analysis:
{{if .Agreements}}
{{range .Agreements}}- {{.}}
{{end}}
{{else}}
No established agreements yet.
{{end}}

### Divergences to Resolve
The arbiter identified these divergences that need resolution:
{{if .Divergences}}
{{range .Divergences}}
#### {{.Category}}
- Your position: {{.YourPosition}}
- Other agents: {{.OtherPositions}}
- Arbiter guidance: {{.Guidance}}
{{end}}
{{else}}
No specific divergences identified.
{{end}}

### Missing Perspectives
{{if .MissingPerspectives}}
These aspects need to be addressed:
{{range .MissingPerspectives}}- {{.}}
{{end}}
{{else}}
No missing perspectives identified.
{{end}}

## Your Task

Generate V{{.Round}} as the **BEST POSSIBLE ANALYSIS** - complete, definitive, and autonomous:

1. **SYNTHESIZE strengths** - Integrate the best insights from all agents into your analysis
2. **PRESERVE agreements** - Include consensus points as your own statements (without mentioning they are consensus)
3. **RESOLVE divergences** - Investigate the code and take a grounded position
4. **FILL gaps** - Add missing perspectives, investigating the code
5. **ELIMINATE errors** - Don't include anything you can't verify with evidence
6. **NO REFERENCES** - NEVER mention previous versions, arbiters, or other agents

**REMEMBER**: The reader of your V{{.Round}} doesn't know that previous versions existed. Write as if this were your only and definitive analysis.
{{else}}
## Ultra-Critical Review

This is your opportunity to improve your analysis before it is compared with other agents.

### Your Task

Generate V{{.Round}} as the **BEST POSSIBLE ANALYSIS** - complete, definitive, and autonomous:

1. **Verify each statement** - Is it grounded in code with specific file:line?
2. **Question assumptions** - Did you assume something without verifying? Is there circular logic?
3. **Identify omissions** - What important aspects did you NOT cover? Investigate them now
4. **Look for counterexamples** - Is there code that contradicts your conclusions?
5. **Eliminate the unverifiable** - If you can't ground something, DO NOT include it

### Quality Criteria

Your V{{.Round}} must be a **complete, autonomous, and definitive** document:

- **NO REFERENCES** to previous versions - write as if it were your only analysis
- **Grounded** - each point with specific code evidence
- **Complete** - covers all relevant aspects
- **Specific** - fewer generalities, more concrete references
- **Clean** - no hallucinations or unverified statements

**REMEMBER**: The reader doesn't know that previous versions existed. Write as if this were your only and definitive analysis.

## Output Requirements

Generate your V{{.Round}} analysis in markdown format with these characteristics:

1. **Complete document** - Must contain the entire analysis, no references to previous versions
2. **Clear structure** - Use sections that best communicate the findings
3. **Specific evidence** - Cite files and lines of code
4. **Autonomous** - Any reader must understand the analysis without seeing V{{.PreviousRound}}
{{if .OutputFilePath}}

Write your complete V{{.Round}} analysis to the following file:

```
{{.OutputFilePath}}
```

**IMPORTANT - File format:**
- Write ONLY the analysis content in markdown
- DO NOT add YAML frontmatter (`---` ... `---` blocks at the beginning)
- DO NOT add metadata, file headers, or system information
- DO NOT include markers like `# File:` or file comments
- Content must start directly with your analysis

Use your file writing tool to create this markdown document.
